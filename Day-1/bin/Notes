//What is MVC ?
We will not be writining code for every student like if there is afile and someone want to insert all that to database through java how will we do that




jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/simplilearn

1. We want to connect "some database" through JDBC :
2. "some database" = mysql :
3. Where is this data base Located "localhost" :
4. In which port sql is running -  3306 :
5. And use the datbase called "simplilearn" * User defined 




        

1. Home Work for STATEMENT :
	UPDATE
	DELETE

2. Home Work for PREPARED STATEMENT :
	UPDATE
	DELETE
	SELECT


1. What are the JDBC steps we have to write to connect with DB?
2. Explain URL.
3. Diff between Statement & Prepared Statement ?
4. Internally Prepared Statement which Interface refering -> Statement
public abstract interface java.sql.PreparedStatement extends java.sql.Statement 

5. What will happen when driver class is loaded ? 
Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");	
 Task 1 : OracleDriver od = new OracleDriver();
          Driver od = new Driver();
 Task 2 : Registering the Driver class instance with the Driver Manager
           DriverManager.registerDriver(od);
